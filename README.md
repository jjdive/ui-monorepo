# How we got to this setup

Start by creating a new workspace. We can use the following command that will help us set it up.

```
npx create-nx-workspace@latest package-based --preset=npm
```

Install `@jscutlery/semver` which is an Nx plugin for versioning using SemVer and CHANGELOG generation powered by Conventional Commits.

```
npm install -D @jscutlery/semver @nrwl/devkit
nx g @jscutlery/semver:install
```
